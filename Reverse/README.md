<b>Name of the Question: LOCKED OUT(250)</b><br>
<b>DESCRIPTION<br>
This is a fancy looking lock, I wonder what would happen if you broke it open?</b>
<br>
<br>
In this question we have to crack the password so first i checked the functions in the gdb.The functions were :<br><br>
0x00000590  strcmp@plt<br>
0x000005a0  printf@plt<br>
0x000005b0  strcspn@plt<br>
0x000005c0  free@plt<br>
0x000005d0  fgets@plt<br>
0x000005e0  getegid@plt<br>
0x000005f0  puts@plt<br>
0x00000600  system@plt<br>
0x00000610  strlen@plt<br>
0x00000620  __libc_start_main@plt<br>
0x00000630  __strdup@plt<br>
0x00000640  memfrob@plt<br>
0x00000650  setresgid@plt<br>
0x00000660  __cxa_finalize@plt<br>
0x00000668  __gmon_start__@plt<br>
0x00000670  main

<br>
We can see that strcmp is used in program so we checked for valid strings in the file but could'nt find any valid key.That means it is dynamically generating string and comparing it.
<br>
Then instead of using gdb i used <b>ltrace</b> and saw that in strcmp my string is compared to "aXat9r45UtyMjw4i5Wh8swVWmEg3vAbW" 
<br>

<br>
so first i thought that i have found the password !! but when i entered it in executable file it says key failed!!!!<br>
So i again used ltrace and this time i entered "aXat9r45UtyMjw4i5Wh8swVWmEg3vAbW" in key.Now this time strcmp was returning  : -90 !!
<br>

<br>
This resulted that the string is not complete password, there are more letters in it.And -90 indicates the alphabet : Z as it's ascii is 90 so that means our new string is "aXat9r45UtyMjw4i5Wh8swVWmEg3vAbWZ" and again i got some other negative integer in ltrace when i  entered new string.<br>
So i made a python script that collects the integer and add to the string and then again calls the ltrace untill strcmp return 0.<br>

<br>
<b>NOTE : YOU CAN FIND THIS PYTHON FILE IN THE SAME REPOSITORY WITH NAME "solution.py"</b><br><br>
So the final String i got was <b>"aXat9r45UtyMjw4i5Wh8swVWmEg3vAbWZaijTWP8"</b>
<br><br>
I entered the String in password and entered the shell.Then opened the flag.txt and got the flag.
<br>
<b>FLAG</b> : IceCTF{you_m3ddling_k1ds}
