Name of the Question : CAVE 50pts
CATEGORY :BINARY EXPLOITATION

DESCRIPTION (as per the Icectf webste):
You stumbled upon a cave! I've heard some caves hold secrets.. can you find the secrets hidden within its depths?
shout.c

"The file C was also given to US.""

Write up:

(This machine which was given to us was running LINUX Distro)
In the given code we can see that there is a function(void shell()) which is being never called.
This give us the idea that it is clearly concept of "Returned oriented programming (ROP)" we have to fill the buffer follewed by the address of the function (void shell()).
In the function it is seen that a new terminal shell will be opened when it is called which will have the permission to open  "flag.txt"

so in the gdb using command `info functions`  we find the address of the function shell which was "0x0804850b"
but we have to write it in "Little Endian" because of the current architecture used.

So basically we have to make a segmentation fault and do buffer overflow.We had a chr[16] but we needed a strong nmber to make segfault so we choose 28.

So the final command will be like this to execute the program.

--> ./shout $(python -c `print("A"*28+"\x0b\x85\x04\x08")`)
AFTER OPENING THE FILE FLAG APPEARED : "IceCTF{i_dont_think_caveman_overflowed_buffers}"

Further implementation you can see in the Photo attached!!
